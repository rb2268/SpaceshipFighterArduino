Project: My own StarshipFighter Python game with Hardware compatibility

Goal: Add Hardware functionality, with a Joystick and LED lights
 to control a fully interactable game. 

Skills required:
 - Learn Pyserial and create a feedback loop between the C++ Arduino code and
 Python code
 - Create a Python Virtual Environment on VSCode to run and store all
 elements of the code
 - Use a working Python game and implement the Joystick hardware analog input
 (comes from two potentiometers side by side)

Skills learned along the way:
 - Made a Python Script to facilitate running the program
 - Learned the functionality of both 'pip' and 'conda' through Python
 virtual environment

**Pre-compiling: **
 - Activate the Python virtual environment to get out of (base)
and into (venv)
 - (if pygame and pyserial aren't installed) Use pip install pygame and 
 pip install pyserial

Compile:
I use a script to make compilation easier: 'gamerun'
You can also compile by doing cd into the directory that contains '__main__.py'
then pressing the triangle on the upper left side of the screen

Hardware intended to use:
 - 2 buttons for the extra weapons
 - A joystick to move the spaceship
